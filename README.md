<!--- this is what I feel after a week of self-teaching creative computing.

















I am still really really shy of touching this media. No matter all kinds of the encouragement.
I wanted to just show this blank page because it is mostlty what it is at this stage.
But I know if I don't start it now the feeling will stay like this and I would never progress.





# H1 a small peek from the outside 

it remind me the first time when I started learning English, Japanese, the foreign languages.
the excitement of getting the key to open the new word.

the hesitation and the unopened mouth.
the closed doors of trying to fill the anxiety of knowledges and hard works.
and the realization of the failure of shyness.

So am I going into that door?

what if I used my grammar wrong. What if I can't understand what they are saying

Yes I will stop thinking and start making.
