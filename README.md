to those whoever find a new world intimadating

**a small peek from the outside**

it remind me the first time when I started learning English, Japanese, the foreign languages.
the excitement of getting the key to open the new word.

the hesitation and the unopened mouth.
the closed doors of trying to fill the anxiety of knowledges and hard works.
and the realization of the failure of shyness.

So am I going into that door?

what if I used my grammar wrong. What if I can't understand what they are saying

Yes I will stop thinking and start making.
