##to those whoever find a new world intimadating

**a small peek from the outside**

*it remind me the first time when I started learning English, Japanese, the foreign languages.
the excitement of getting the key to open the new word.*

*the hesitation and the unopened mouth.*
*the closed doors of trying to fill the anxiety of knowledges and hard works.*
*and the realization of the failure of shyness.*

*So am I going into that door?*

*what if I used my grammar wrong. What if I can't understand what they are saying.*

*Yes I will stop thinking and start making.*
